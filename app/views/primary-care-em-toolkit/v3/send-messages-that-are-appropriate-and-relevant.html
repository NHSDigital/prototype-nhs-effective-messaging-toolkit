      <h1 class="nhsuk-heading-xl">Send messages that are personalised, appropriate and relevant</h1>
      <p class="nhsuk-body-l">Different types of messages will need different levels of personalisation.  
      <p class="nhsuk-body-l">Think about the context of the messages you send.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body-l">Adapt the content and tone to make your messages appropriate for the situation.</p>
      
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Send relevant messages to specific groups of people</h2> 
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Research has shown that engagement with messages falls if patients receive too many messages that are not relevant to them.</p>
      
      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Identify specific groups and tailor your message content</h2> 
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Use your messaging software to identify groups of patients that are as specific as possible.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Then use information you have available to make the message content as relevant as possible to those specific groups.</p>
      <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Example</h4>
      <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
        <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Example: </span>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">You may have identified a group of patients who you know have previously attended their screening appointments but missed their most recent one.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">You can send a message reminding them of the importance of regular screening.</p> 
      </div>

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Consider different channels to reach wider groups</h3>  
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Do not send messages to very large groups of patients unless there is a real need to.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Consider whether general information can be shared in other ways, like putting a banner on your website or a post on social media.</p>
      
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Confidential content</h2>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Be cautious about what personal information you include in messages. The messages you send to a patient could be seen by other people. For example, many families will share a single mobile phone.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Some people also regularly change their mobile number, so it is important to confirm patientsâ€™ contact details at every opportunity.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Include enough information for the patient to understand what the message means and any action they need to take, without including any specific details of their care.</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">Follow the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/voice-and-tone">Voice and tone section of our Content guide</a> to write messages that are:</p>
