      <h1 class="nhsuk-heading-xl">Send messages that are personalised, appropriate and relevant</h1>
      <p class="nhsuk-body-l">Different types of messages will need different levels of personalisation.  

      <p class="nhsuk-body-l">Think about the context of the messages you send.</p>
      
      <p class="nhsuk-body-l">Adapt the content and tone to make your messages appropriate for the situation.</p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Target your batch messages to specific groups</h2> 

      <p class="nhsuk-body">Think about who your message is relevant to. Use your messaging software to identify a group of patients that’s as specific as possible.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">For example, a message might only be relevant to patients with diabetes who are on a certain medication.</p> 

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Research insight</h3> 

      <p class="nhsuk-body">Engagement with messages falls if patients receive too many messages that are not relevant to them.</p>
      
      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Consider different channels to reach wider groups</h3>  

      <p class="nhsuk-body">Use the information you know to make message content as relevant as possible to specific groups.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">For example, you may have a group of patients have previously attended their screening appointments but missed their most recent one. You can send a message reminding them of the importance of regular screening.</p>
      
            
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Tailor your message content</h2> 

      <p class="nhsuk-body">Think about who your message is relevant to. Use your messaging software to identify a group of patients that’s as specific as possible.</p>
      
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Confidential content</h2>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">Be cautious about what personal information you include in messages. The messages you send to a patient could be seen by other people. For example, many families will share a single mobile phone.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Some people also regularly change their mobile number, so it is important to confirm patients’ contact details at every opportunity.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Include enough information for the patient to understand what the message means and any action they need to take, without including any specific details of their care.</p>
