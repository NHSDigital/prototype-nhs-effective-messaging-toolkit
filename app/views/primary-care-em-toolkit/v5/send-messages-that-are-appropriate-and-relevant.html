      <h1 class="nhsuk-heading-xl">Send messages that are appropriate and relevant</h1>
      <p class="nhsuk-body-l">Different types of messages will need different levels of personalisation.  
      <p>Think about the context of the messages you send.</p>
      <p>Adapt the content and tone to make your messages appropriate for the situation.</p>
      
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Send relevant messages to specific groups of people</h2> 
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Research shows that patients' engagement falls if they receive too many messages that are not relevant to them.</p>
      
      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Identify specific groups and tailor your message content</h2> 
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Use your clinical system to identify groups of patients that are as specific as possible.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Then make the message content as relevant as possible to those specific groups. Use all the information you have available.</p>
      <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Example</h4>
      <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
        <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Example: </span>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">A group of patients have missed their most recent screening appointment. They have attended previous screening appointments.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">You can send a message reminding them of the importance of regular screening.</p> 
      </div>

      <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Consider different channels to reach wider groups</h3>  
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Sending a message to a very large group of patients can mean it's not relevant to everyone who receives it. It can also be very expensive.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Consider whether you can share general information in other ways. For example, putting a banner on your website or a post on social media.</p>
      
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Confidential content</h2>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Be cautious about what personal information you include in messages. Other people could see the messages, which could put the patient at risk. For example, many families will share a single mobile phone.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Some people also often change their mobile number. Regularly check that patient contact details are up to date when you speak to them, and ensure you are entering the details into your system accurately.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Include enough information for the patient to understand what the message means and any action they need to take. But do not include any specific details of their care.</p>
