      <h2>Make standard messages accessible</h2>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">Aim to make all the text messages, emails and app messages you send accessible to people who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>use assistive technology, like a screenreader</li>
        <li>have a low level of literacy</li>
        <li>have low numeracy</li>
        <li>have a learning difficulty or autism</li>
        <li>have co-ordination difficulties</li>
        <li>do not speak English as their first language</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This will reduce the number of messages you need to send in alternative formats. These are also known as accessible formats.</p>
      <p>Use our <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/how-we-write">content guide</a> to write messages that are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>clear and in in plain English, so someone with a reading age of 9 to 11 years can understand them</li>
        <li>concise, with short sentences and paragraphs</li>
        <li>in the active voice, not passive voice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Specific pages of the content guide tell you how to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/a-to-z-of-nhs-health-writing">use words and phrases that patients understand</a></li>

    <h2>The Accessible Information Standard</h2>
    <p>All organisations that provide NHS care are [legally] required to follow the Accessible Information Standard. The standard outlines how you must meet the information and communication support needs of people with a disability, impairment or sensory loss. This includes patients and service users, and their carers and parents.</p>
    <h3>Who the Accessible Information Standard might apply to</h3>
    <p>You must ask anyone who uses your services and has a disability, impairment or sensory loss if they have any communication or information needs.</p>
    <details class="nhsuk-details nhsuk-expander">
      <summary class="nhsuk-details__summary">
        <span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text">
          Patient codes that might indicate an additional communication need
        </span>
      </summary>
      <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
        <ul>
          <li>Registered blind or partially sighted</li>
          <li>Hearing loss</li>
          <li>Hearing aid user</li>
          <li>Registered deaf</li>
          <li>Sensori-neural deafness</li>
          <li>Autistic spectrum disorder</li>
          <li>Learning disability</li>
          <li>Aphasia</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </details>
    <p>However, you should base decisions on a patient's communication needs, rather than their diagnosis.</p>

      <p>“If people cannot get information about their healthcare they understand, this can have a significant impact on their mental health and can lead to them missing doctor’s appointments or taking the wrong medication, putting them in danger." — Louise Ansari, national director at Healthwatch England </p>
    </div>

    <h3>What you need to do</h3>
    <p>You must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ask them to define their needs, including the format of messages they will be able to access and understand</li>
      <li>record their needs (not the disability, impairment or sensory loss) in a clear, unambiguous and standardised way</li>
      <li>make sure their needs are flagged and easily visible to anyone accessing the record</li>
      <li>only send messages to the patient in the agreed format, including any automatically generated messages</li>
      <li>share their needs as part of existing data sharing processes, for example when referring a patient, so they will continue to receive accessible messages</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Digital formats</h2>
    <p>Many people with communication needs use assistive technology to help them to understand written information. For these people, sending messages by email [ADD LINK] or text message [ADD LINK] will mean they can use their preferred technology.</p>
      <h2>Alternative formats (accessible formats)</h2>
    <p>Some people will need messages to be sent in an alternative format. These are also called accessible formats.</p>
    <p>People with a visual impairment may need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>large print</li>
      <li>Braille</li>
      <li>an audio file, sent digitally or on a CD-ROM</li>
    </ul>
<p>People with a learning disability or a low level of literacy may need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>easy read</li>
  <li>Makaton</li>
</ul>
<p>People who are Deaf or have hearing loss may need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>British Sign Language (BSL)</li>
  <li>Makaton</li>
  <li>textphone</li>
</ul>
<p>People with co-ordination difficulties may need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>large print</li>
  <li>audio</li>
  <li>telephone</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-communication/accessible-communication-formats">Find out more about alternative communication formats</a>.</p>
<h2>Use inclusive language</h2>  
<p>Use our content guide to create inclusive content about:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/inclusive-content/age">age</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/inclusive-content/disabilities-and-conditions">disabilities and conditions</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/inclusive-content/sex-gender-and-sexuality">sex, gender and sexuality</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/inclusive-content/skin-symptoms">skin symptoms</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Learning disability and autism programme has also created <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/learning-disabilities/about/get-involved/involving-people/making-information-and-the-words-we-use-accessible/">guidance about how to talk about people with a learning disability or autism</a>.</p>  
<h2>Inclusion health groups</h2>
<p>People in inclusion health groups include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>people who experience homelessness</li>
  <li>people with drug and alcohol dependence</li>
  <li>vulnerable migrants and refugees</li>
  <li>Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller communities</li>
  <li>people in contact with the justice system</li>
  <li>victims of modern slavery</li>
  <li>sex workers</li>
  <li>other marginalised groups</li>
</ul>
<p>People in these groups often face discrimination and stigma. This can result in poor access to healthcare services and make it difficult for them to look after their health and wellbeing. </p>
<p>People in these groups are more likely to have low levels of literacy, low or no fluency levels of English and to experience digital exclusion. They may also have no fixed address or no phone.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/migrant-health-guide">Advice and guidance on the health needs of migrant patients for healthcare practitioners</a>.</p>
<h3>Use a personalised approach</h3>
<p>Give people in these groups more choice and control over their health and the way their care is delivered, including how they receive messages:</p>
<ul> 
<li>ask them if they have any communication preferences when they first contact your service</li>
<li>record these preferences and make sure they are flagged to relevant staff to ensure continuity of care and ongoing support</li>
<li>translate message content, if needed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Translating message content into other languages</h2>
<p>You must make all possible efforts to meet patients' communication needs in languages other than English.</p>
<p>Ask patients to tell you their preferred written language. Record this preference in their health record and include this information when referring patients to other healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>Translate message content into a patient's preferred language whenever possible.</p>
<p>You should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>provide the original message to the translator in plain English</li>
  <li>consider if audio-recorded spoken interpretation of information may be a better option if the person has a low level of literacy</li>
  <li>consider if visual content like images and diagrams may be more helpful</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid Google Translate and other automated online translation services, as the translations could be poor quality.</p>
